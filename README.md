# Undetectable Reverse Shell â€“ Single Mode Edition

![Undetectable Reverse Shell](https://github.com/1603160/Undetectable-Reverse-Shell-1.0/blob/main/reverse-shell-undetectable-1.0.png?raw=true)

## Overview

This tool generates a powerful, obfuscated reverse shell payload using **CMD + PowerShell**, encoding the final payload in **Base64** and using **dynamic variable renaming** for stealth and detection evasion. The goal is to produce a payload that can be executed directly via CMD with a high success rate in bypassing basic detection mechanisms.
