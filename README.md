## Overview
Welcome, brave adventurers, to the Undetectable Reverse Shell 1.0, an arcane spell crafted in the Python language that summons network spirits to forge a hidden passage between two realms. This incantation utilizes mysterious PowerShell chants to bypass the watchful eyes of the royal guards and is armed with three potent obfuscation techniques to cloak its workings from prying eyes.

## Getting Started

To master this spell, follow these simple guidelines.

### Requirements

- A cauldron with Python 3.x brew
- A key to the castle's server chamber (or a machine running the Windows operating system)

### Installation

1. Use a magical mirror to clone the repository:

   ```
2. Traverse to the script's secret chamber:

   ```

## Invocation

Invoke the Undetectable Reverse Shell by executing the Python script without any arguments. The script will guide you through an interactive process to enter the necessary details.

```
python3 generador.py
```

## Obfuscation Techniques

Upon invocation, you will be prompted to choose from one of the three obfuscation techniques:

1. Basic - The spell will be cast with randomly generated variable names to disguise its intent.
2. Base64 - The incantation will be encoded in Base64, concealing it within an arcane script.
3. Mixed - A combination of basic obfuscation and Base64 encoding for added mystique.

Choose wisely to match the level of stealth required for your quest.
